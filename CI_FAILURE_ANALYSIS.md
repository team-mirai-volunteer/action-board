# CI Failure Analysis - PR #1251

## Overview
This document analyzes the CI failure in PR #1251 for the poster_boards deletion migration to determine if the failures are related to the migration changes.

## Migration Details
- **File**: `20250715065011_delete_duplicate_poster_boards.sql`
- **Purpose**: Delete duplicate poster_boards records based on specific conditions
- **Operations**: Only DELETE statements targeting specific records
- **Local Testing**: ✅ PASSED - Migration executes successfully with proper logging

## CI Failure Summary
- **Failed Check**: "Build & Tests" (job_id: 45985562942)
- **Jest Unit Tests**: ✅ All PASSED
- **E2E Tests**: ❌ 8 failed, 64 passed
- **Failed Test File**: `tests/e2e/user-mission.spec.ts`

## Specific E2E Test Failures
All failures are timeout errors waiting for UI elements:

1. **Authentication State Check Failure**
   ```
   Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
   Locator: getByTestId("usermenubutton")
   ```

2. **Mission Content Loading Failure**
   ```
   Error: Timed out 5000ms waiting for expect(locator).toBeVisible()
   Locator: getByText('(seed) ゴミ拾いをしよう (成果物不要)', { exact: true })
   ```

## Analysis Conclusion

### ✅ Migration is NOT the cause of CI failures

**Evidence:**
1. **Scope Isolation**: Migration only affects `poster_boards` table records
2. **No Authentication Impact**: DELETE operations don't affect user authentication systems
3. **No UI Dependencies**: poster_boards data doesn't control UI element visibility
4. **Local Success**: Migration executes perfectly in local environment
5. **Unit Tests Pass**: All Jest unit tests pass, indicating code quality is maintained

### ❌ Actual Issue: E2E Test Environment Problems

The failures indicate:
- Authentication state not properly established in CI environment
- UI elements not rendering as expected during test execution
- Possible timing issues or test environment configuration problems

## Recommendation

The migration is ready for merge. The CI failures are unrelated E2E test environment issues that should be addressed separately from this migration PR.

## Local Verification Results

```bash
# Migration test - PASSED
supabase db reset
# Output: Migration applied successfully with proper logging

# Code formatting - PASSED  
npm run biome:check:write
# Output: Checked 345 files, Fixed 1 file

# Database state - VERIFIED
# Migration logs show 0 records deleted (expected in clean environment)
# All verification checks passed
```
